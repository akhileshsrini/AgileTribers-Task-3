              A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a
              bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended
              beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or
              high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a
              source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning
              liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it
              buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside
              the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly
              beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at
              the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same
              pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the
              envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the
              balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a
              fire-resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been
              made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of
              various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used
              for most non-commercial and many commercial applications.

              The hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight
              technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight in
              the world was performed in Paris, France, by Jean-François Pilâtre
              de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783,[1]
              in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers.[2] Hot air
              balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply
              drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.
